Ryan's Ask and Criteria:

Build me a gradio dashboard that shows me the following:
- Interest rates for the following currencies: EUR, GBP, CNY, AUD, CAD, USD
- Commodity evaluation for: oil, gold, silver, btc, eth [x]
- Countries GDP for: US, China, UK, Canada, Australia [x]
- Inflation rate for: US, China, UK, Canada, Australia
- CPI for: US, China, UK, Canada, Australia

Make the time step yearly for these. Eg we start on a 1 year time step and can go back 3 years or as long as data sources let us. The data from this cannot be self created. It needs to be retrieved from an external source. YahooFinance is an example but there can be other sources used too as long as they are free.
